**MERN-basic** <br />
Created the framework of a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS) stack. The MERN architecture constructs a 3-tier architecture (frontend, backend, database) entirely using JavaScript and JSON.

* Mongoose: library to make database queries and actions, communicate with the database in an easy manner
* Cors: connection between React and backend
* Nodemon: Develop faster
